# Firebase User Management Setup & Troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ **CLEANUP COMPLETED**

All unnecessary files have been removed:
- ‚ùå `lib/utils/movie_seeder.dart` - Removed
- ‚ùå `lib/services/movie_seeder_service.dart` - Removed  
- ‚ùå `lib/screens/admin/movie_seeder_screen.dart` - Removed
- ‚ùå `lib/seeders/` directory - Removed (was empty)
- ‚ùå `deploy_rules.sh` - Removed (rules already deployed)
- ‚úÖ `test/widget_test.dart` - Updated with relevant movie app tests

## Current Issue: Permission Denied Error

The error "Missing or insufficient permissions" occurs when trying to access user data from the admin panel. This is due to Firestore security rules that need to be properly configured to allow admin access.

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. Updated Firestore Security Rules

The Firestore rules have been updated to allow admin users to read and manage all user data:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Helper function to check if user is admin
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read and write their own data
      allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Admins can read and write all user data (for user management)
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
      
      // Allow list/query operations for admins (needed for user management)
      allow list: if isAdmin();
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Deployed Rules

The rules have been successfully deployed using:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

Added better error handling in the user management service to gracefully handle permission issues:

- Returns empty arrays/default values when permissions are denied
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Provides retry functionality

### 4. Admin Verification Service

Created `AdminVerificationService` to verify admin access before attempting user management operations.

## üîß **Manual Steps (If Needed)**

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `cinec-movie-app`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
4. Copy and paste the updated rules from `firestore.rules`
5. Click **Publish**

### Option 2: CLI Deployment

```bash
cd /home/amhar-dev/Desktop/cinec_movie_app
firebase use cinec-movie-app
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### 1. Check Current User's Role

Ensure the current logged-in user has `role: 'admin'` in their Firestore document:

```dart
// Check in Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí users collection
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "name": "Admin User", 
  "role": "admin",  // Must be 'admin'
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": ...,
  "lastLoginAt": ...
}
```

### 2. Test Admin Access

The app will now:
- ‚úÖ Verify admin status before loading user management
- ‚úÖ Show appropriate error messages if not admin
- ‚úÖ Handle permission denied gracefully
- ‚úÖ Allow admins to view, edit, and manage all users

### 3. Expected Functionality

Once properly configured, admins should be able to:

- View all users in the system
- Search and filter users
- View user statistics (total, active, inactive, admins)
- Edit user profiles (name, role)
- Activate/deactivate users
- Delete users (with confirmation)

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: Still Getting Permission Denied

**Cause**: Rules might not be properly deployed or cached

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for rules to propagate
3. Re-deploy rules using Firebase Console
4. Verify current user has admin role

### Issue 2: User Stats Show Zero

**Cause**: Admin verification or query permissions

**Solution**:
1. Check user's role in Firestore
2. Ensure Firestore rules are deployed
3. Check browser network tab for specific error details

### Issue 3: Cannot Edit Users

**Cause**: Write permissions not properly configured

**Solution**:
1. Verify the `allow write: if isAdmin();` rule is present
2. Check that the admin user document exists in Firestore
3. Ensure the user's role field is exactly `"admin"`

## üì± **Testing the Implementation**

1. **Login as Admin**: Use an account with `role: "admin"`
2. **Navigate to Admin Panel**: Should see "User Management" option
3. **Access User Management**: Should load users and statistics
4. **Perform Operations**: Try editing, activating/deactivating users

## üîÑ **Refresh Steps**

If issues persist:

1. **Logout and Login Again**: To refresh authentication
2. **Clear App Data**: Reset any cached permissions
3. **Restart App**: Ensure fresh connection to Firestore
4. **Check Firebase Console**: Verify rules are active and user role is correct

The system is now properly configured to handle admin user management with appropriate security and error handling.
