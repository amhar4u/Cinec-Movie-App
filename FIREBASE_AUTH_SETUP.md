## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Admin Secret Key**: Currently set to `CINEC_ADMIN_2024`. You should:
   - Change this to a secure, random key
   - Consider implementing server-side validation
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Firestore Rules**: Make sure to set up proper security rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.role == 'admin' && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Profile Avatar System

The profile avatar system automatically:
- Uses custom profile picture if available
- Falls back to first letter of user's name
- Generates colorful gradient background
- Supports different sizes and online indicators

## 📱 Responsive Design

All screens are responsive and work on:
- Mobile devices (portrait/landscape)
- Tablets
- Desktop applications

## 🔄 State Management

- Uses Provider for state management
- Real-time authentication state listening
- User model caching in AuthProvider
- Automatic UI updates on authentication changes

**Note**: This implementation provides a complete authentication system with role-based access, profile management, and proper navigation flow. The admin creation is protected by a secret key, and user data is properly stored in Firestore with appropriate defaults.
